          This is a day we have both been looking forward to ever since we started dating over 18 months ago.
          It's a special day to me, because i will finally get to call you my wife. You will be the mother of my kids, my companion, my best friend and my pride.

          Congratulations to both of us for coming this far in our love life, and taking this bold step of deciding to spend the rest of our lives together.

        <p>
          You are an amazing person, I am glad that I found you. Without you, I don’t know how my world would be. You have totally transformed me. Before you came into my life, I never knew what it felt like to love someone this much, my heart was empty, but now it’s full of love.
        </p>
        <p>
          I can confidently say i am the luckiest man on earth to have you as my wife.
        </p>
        <p>
          I Love you!
